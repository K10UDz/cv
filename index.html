        <p><em>Podcast Producer, Web Developer & Creative</em></p>
        <p>I am an Actor 🎭, Dancer 🕺🏾, Poet 📝, Writer ✍🏾, Music Producer 🎹, DJ 🎧, Podcaster 🎙 and Web Developer 💻.<br><br>Who hosts and produces two podcasts; My Opinion Means Nothing... & The More You Know Mondays;<br><br><a 
          href="https://audioboom.com/channels/4936269" target="_blank">My Opinion Means Nothing...</a> the
          title comes from the standing point that everyone always says that their opinion means nothing but it doesn’t exactly mean that, it just depends on who hears your opinion and what they do with it... I host the show on my own and each
          episode I
          have a different person with me as my co-hosts/guests. I’m usually joined by poets and creatives but not limited to these anyone with an opinion is welcome. Using the news and what’s happening in the world as a catalyst to talk about deeper
          issues,
          mainly I'm interesting in seeing where the conversation goes…<br><br><a href="https://redcircle.com/shows/the-more-you-know-mondays" target="_blank">The More You Know Mondays</a>, is a show that I created from my love of random interesting
          facts
          and finding out more about them. It could be about an event in time from the past
          or even recent history or just an interesting fact, either way every Monday there'll be a different interesting random fact for you to learn a bit more about.<br><br>I'm also a self taught Web Developer, learning to code through online
          courses
          and my own ingenuity.</p>
